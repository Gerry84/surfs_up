## Overview of the analysis
Analysis to ensure that weather will not impact our "Surf n' Shake" shop in Oahu Hawaii negatively. 
To get a good idea of the weather during the whole year, two months at different points of the year where choosen: June and December

## Results
* The outcomes are very similar for the months of June and December.<br>
* This shows that Oahu Hawaii has good weather all year round and there shouldn't be a negative impact due to weather.<br>
* The first quantile for December shows a temperature of 69 fahrenheit which should still invite people to enjoy ice cream and surfing.<br>
